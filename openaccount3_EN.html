                </div>
                <p class="desc">
                    Investment in Foreign Securities involves risks. The Customer could lose some or all amount of investment. Thus, prior to 
making a decision to invest, the Customer should carefully review and consider the following information contained in this risk 
disclosure statement, which describes the material risks that could significantly affect the investment. This risk disclosure 
statement is not meant to be all-inclusive, rather, it is intended to highlight certain significant factors and risks relating to the 
investment in Foreign Securities. Therefore, there may be other risks that are currently unknown or believed to be immaterial, 
which could turn out to be material in the future.<br>
The Customer should not construe this risk disclosure statement as business, legal, tax or accounting advice. The Customer 
should consult the relevant advisers with respect to the investment in Foreign Securities and the Customer should refrain 
from entering into the investment in Foreign Securities unless the Customer has fully understood the associated risks and 
determined that the investment in Foreign Securities is appropriate for the Customer.
                </p>
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>
                        <u>Overall investment risk</u> The Foreign Securities investment risks the loss of some or all the amount of principal. Many 
                        unforeseeable events, including actions by various government agencies, economic domestic and international political and 
                        situations and other events of force majeure, such as acts of god, and certain other events beyond reasonable control (e.g. 
                        war, riot, unrest, terrorism), may cause sharp securities market and price fluctuations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Market Risk / Price Volatility Risk</u>
                        The Foreign Securities exchange on which the Securities to be invested are traded
or listed may be in a jurisdiction which may have political, economic, legal and regulatory conditions that differ in certain
significant aspectfromthose prevailing in Thailand. In addition, suchSecuritiesExchange may,inits sole discretion, suspend
or limit the trading from time to time. Changes or fluctuations in or downturn or occurrence of those conditions prevailing
from time to time may have an adverse effect upon the trading volume and price of the Securities.
<br>
Further to the above which are internal factors, trading volume and price of the Securities may also be affected by other 
factors, which are those relating to the Securities themselves or by external factors such as war, global or regional economic 
and/or financial crisis, etc. Changes in these factors may also have an impact upon the trading volume and price of the
Securities.<br>
Moreover, in case that the invested Securities are derivative, the price fluctuation of such derivative may require the 
Customer to make an additional payment or undertake any action in addition to the initial investment amount. This is to 
ensure that it will cover, among other things, the initial margin or the related obligation of the derivative investment or loss 
derived from the investment in the derivative.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Settlement Risk</u>
                        Foreign Securities Investment involves the execution, and settlement in Foreign Securities exchange 
which laws or regulations might differ in each relevant exchange. The Customer might not be protected in some certain levels 
which apply to domestic clients.<br>
The settlement of the Securities and/or the underlying goods in such exchanges may be less developed or less 
standardized and, in some cases, less reliable than Thailand. Furthermore, fees related to settlement of the Securities and/or 
the underlying goods in the foreign exchange may be higher than those of Thailand or higher than customer's expectation. 
Also, due to the fact that settlement of the Securities and/or the underlying goods between Thailand and foreign countries or 
the Thai Securities exchange and Foreign Securities exchanges are not systematically linked. Thus, the settlement process 
may take longer time than expected. These factors might cause higher risk, which include risks of fraud, delivery failure, or
any confusion in settlement conditions or process which may result in loss, loss of opportunities, delays and cause more 
operational and legal costs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Regulatory Risk</u> Since the Foreign Securities investment is the investment in Securities which the issuer has his residence 
                        or office, asset, personnel and/or other benefit in foreign counties and/or in Securities with the underlying goods located in 
                        foreign countries which are subject to various laws or regulations, investments in those or certain countries may be restricted 
                        or controlled in different degrees by relevant local laws or regulations. These restrictions or controls may include, but not be 
                        limited to, governmental or third party approval prior to an investment; limitation of investment by foreign investors in certain 
                        businesses; requirement for governmental approval for the repatriation of investment return, capital or proceeds of sales of 
                        Foreign Securities; or tax imposed on or related to the investment in Securities by foreign investors. Moreover, certain laws 
                        and regulations in those counties may have an ambiguity in interpretation and may be subject to the interpretation of a local
                        authority which may interpret those laws or regulations not to be in favor of the Customer. Also, each country will, from time 
                        to time, enact new laws or regulations, and there is always an uncertainty as to the scope and content of such new laws and 
                        regulations. These matters may have an adverse effect upon the investment.<br>
                        In addition to the restrictions and controls as mentioned above, certain countries may have limited or less protection with 
respect to the Customer's rights as the holders of the Securities, including rights to the lawsuit and the enforceability of 
judgment. The efficacy of the judicial systems in each country varies, and the Customer may have difficulties in successfully
pursuing claims in the courts of such jurisdictions. Moreover, to the extent the Customer may obtain a judgment but is 
required to seek its enforcement in the courts of one of the countries in which the Customer invests or of the issuer country, 
there can be no assurance that such courts will enforce such judgment.                   
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Liquidity Risk</u> Even where the Customer invests in listed Securities, the Securities exchanges of some countries may be 
                        small and illiquid, or in some case the Securities may not be listed. In addition, the liquidity of the Securities may subject to 
                        other factors including, but not limited to, the nature of the Securities, the purchase or sale or investment condition and 
                        internal and/or external factors of the country where the Securities exchange is located. The illiquidity may reduce the 
                        Customer's ability to purchase or sale or to take any relevant action related to such securities, or make it difficult to purchase 
                        or sale such Securities at a favorable or desirable price or in a sufficient quantity to meet the investment objectives of the
                        Customer.                    
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Currency Risk</u> As the investments in the Foreign Securities investment and/or any action relating to the investment in 
                        Foreign Securities is settled in foreign currencies, returns on the investments and/or any action with respect to the investments 
                        may be significantly effected by currency risk. The Customer is subject to the risk in case of the change of value of foreign 
                        currencies as compare to value of Thai Baht, such event might happen at some periods of time, or permanently. If the 
                        devaluation occurs in any currency, the Customer may suffer currency losses.                   
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Credit Risk</u> The Customer may be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparty, including the issuer of the purchased 
                        Securities [whether invest in listed of non-listed firm]. The Customer may be subject to risk of loss in the total or some amount 
                        if the counterparty or the issuer goes bankrupt or insolvent or unable or unwilling to pay debtor to perform his obligation, 
                        including the obligation to return the investment capital or redeem the invested Securities.                    
                    </li>
                    <li>
